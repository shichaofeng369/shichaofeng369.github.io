      <description>Abstract
This study studied the relationship between willingness to vote and education level. It was found voters with higher education level are more willing to vote than voters with lower education level. So that this study suggests government to imporve the level of education in the country which might lead to elections with higher participation rates in future.

      <description>XMin is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the blogdown book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal.</description>
